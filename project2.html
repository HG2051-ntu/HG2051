<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project constitutes 30% of your final grade for HG2051. Please
work on the final program in groups of 2-3 and report together.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your programming
and problem-solving abilities through teamwork. If your team has an idea
for another project that you would like to do instead, talk to me for
approval.</p></li>
<li><p>This project involves text classification using machine learning
tools. As with the individual project, your team will be required to
submit data, output, and annotated code along with a short writeup that
describes your goals, process, and results. Your code will be assessed
based on its functionality and simplicity.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-2-text-classification">Project 2: Text
classification</h2>
<p>Text classification is a general term for automatically identifying
properties of a text based on its linguistic content. For this project
you will develop a program that classifies short SMS messages based on
whether they are <code>spam</code> or not (<code>ham</code>). The
initial project code in this repository will help you to get started,
along the following lines:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The corpora you will primarily be using are located in the
<code>datasets</code> subfolder of your repository, and a brief
explanation of each are given here:</p>
<p><code>SMSSpamCollection.txt</code> - this is the full UCI dataset,
which is compiled from various sources. It contains both
<code>ham</code> and <code>spam</code> labeled messages. You can view
and read more about the dataset <a
href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection">here</a>.</p>
<p><code>SMSSpamCollection_500.txt</code> - this is a set of the first
500 messages from the dataset above, and is used in your starter code
for testing.</p>
<p><code>sms_corpus_NUS-ham.txt</code> - this is the full SMS corpus
developed by NUS Singapore for machine learning &amp; NLP. All of these
messages are actual messages collected in Singapore from study
participants. I have reformatted the data to match the format of the
other datasets. You can read more <a
href="https://github.com/kite1988/nus-sms-corpus">here</a>.</p>
<p><code>email_corpus_lingspam.txt</code> - this is a set of real emails
from the Linguist List (a listserve site for dissemination information
about linguistics) along with spam emails. I have reformatted the data
to match the other datasets, including <code>ham</code> and
<code>spam</code> labels. This is the dataset you will be using for
evaluation, and you should not use it for training your classifier. You
can download the original dataset <a
href="http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software_and_datasets/lingspam_public.tar.gz">here</a>.
The zipped folder contains a <code>readme</code> file explaining the
data.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The <a
href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection">SMS
spam collection from UCI</a> will be the set of data that you will use
for training and testing the classifier. Since each of the messages in
this corpus has already been classified as <code>spam</code> or
<code>ham</code>, this allows us to see how well a basic Naive Bayes
NLTK classifier works.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Create a list of <code>spam</code> words and <code>ham</code>
words based on the labels of the short texts. You can either use the
same dataset of messages or another that you can find online. Once you
have sorted and filtered the words, perhaps via frequency distributions,
write a function that uses these words in conjunction with the NLTK
classifier to classify the messages and improve on the base score (83%
accuracy on emails). This process is known as feature
selection/engineering - the goal of the project is to implement other
“features” that you can identify which might improve your
classification. Some ideas for sentiment analysis of movie reviews can
be found <a
href="https://realpython.com/python-nltk-sentiment-analysis/#selecting-useful-features">here</a>.
Keep in mind that successfully differentiating between real and fake
messages/emails may require different features than for differentiating
between the sentiment of movie reviews.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have determined the features that you want to extract,
write a function that automatically extracts these features from the
text as a dictionary. Then use the function to create a list of tuples,
where the first item of the tuple is the dictionary of features and the
second item is the category/classification (“ham” or “spam”) of the
text.</p></li>
<li><p>Split the dataset for training and validation to see how/whether
your features improve classification using, i.e. the Naive Bayes
classification algorithm in NLTK. It is important that whatever
classifier you use, the training data is kept separate from the
testing/validation set, otherwise you are simply letting the model
“memorize” inputs (overfitting) and it will not generalize well to other
datasets.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have a model that you think works pretty well on the SMS
dataset, test its accuracy on the email dataset (which you have not used
for training) to see how well it classifies email texts as ham/spam. At
this point, you can train your classifier on the complete SMS dataset,
since your email dataset is being used for testing (it is ‘unseen’).
Additionally, you can incorporate other datasets (like the complete NUS
SMS dataset or other datasets you can find online) into your training
data. If you do use other datasets, make sure to include them in the git
repository (under the <code>datasets</code> folder) and include links to
your sources in your code/writeup. Your team’s ultimate goal is to
improve the accuracy of your classifier on the unseen email
dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>This code is simply a starting point for exploration. What other
features can you think of and implement to improve accuracy? How does
the accuracy improve with different splits? Try to implement other
classifiers and see how they perform on this dataset. Are there other
lexical resources/corpora or algorithms within NLTK or from other
sources that can improve your results? What is the best accuracy you can
get? How does the genre of text (sms/emails) affect your classifier’s
results?</p></li>
<li><p>With your group, write a roughly 5-page paper (no longer than 10
pages) describing your goals, data, process, and results, and discussing
some of the concerns identified in point 6. This paper should include
relevant linguistic information and citations for your sources. Submit
the paper as a PDF along with your annotated/commented Python code in a
Github repository. The PDF should also be submitted via
TurnItIn.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>Your final updated repository should include a <code>README.md</code>
file (replace this one) with a brief summary of the project and a list
of the items in the repository along with a brief description, a single
python script or a set of scripts/folders containing code to build your
classifier and assess its performance on the
<code>email_corpus_lingspam</code> dataset, an <code>output.txt</code>
file that contains the accuracy results of 10 runs of your final
classifier being trained on the SMS+ dataset and evaluated on the email
corpus dataset, and a PDF of your 5-10 page paper describing your goals,
data, process, and results.</p>
