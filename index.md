Traditionally linguistic analysis was done largely by hand, but
computer-based methods and tools are becoming increasingly widely used
in contemporary research. This course provides an introduction to
skills and resources that can assist the linguist in performing fast,
flexible and accurate quantitative analyses. Students will learn a
scripting language (Python) and use it and the Natural Language Tool
Kit (NLTK) to analyse linguistic phenomena. No previous programming
experience is required: we will teach you the basics of programming,
with an emphasis on useful techniques for processing languages.
