<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project constitutes 30% of your final grade for HG2051. Please
work on the final program and report individually. Your code will be
assessed based on its functionality and simplicity.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your programming
and reasoning abilities by working on a problem individually. If you
have an idea for another project that you would like to do instead, talk
to me for approval.</p></li>
<li><p>This project involves sorting, searching, and classifying lexical
resources. Submission requirements include your data, output, and
annotated code along with a short writeup describing your goals,
process, and results.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-1-multilingual-search">Project 1: Multilingual
search</h2>
<p>While it is relatively easy to search through a corpus of text to
find particular words/collocations/phrases in a single language, there
are very few search tools that will allow you to find matches based on
multiple languages. For this project you will develop a program that
will return matches from multiple levels of an interlinear text.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Find a language with interlinear texts that have been glossed in
English. You can find individual language resources such as for <a
href="https://researchdata.ntu.edu.sg/file.xhtml?fileId=263&amp;version=1.1">Pnar</a>
online, as well as aggregated data such as the <a
href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwcl/odin/">ODIN</a> project. Make
sure you choose a language that has multiple texts available. Once you
have chosen the language, select one of the linguistic texts for testing
your tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a Python script that will read in the text, store it, and
allow for a user to search the data on multiple levels simultaneously,
i.e. <em>text</em>, <em>gloss</em>, <em>part of speech (POS)</em>. The
idea here is that the user should be able to query for all
<code>nouns</code> that have the gloss <strong>dog</strong>, and look at
all sentences with those forms in order to observe the context in which
they occur. The implementation should enable searching using at least
two levels of annotation (i.e. <em>text</em>, <em>gloss</em>), but will
receive a higher score if more than two annotation levels are supported,
as well as if forward and backward searches (i.e. “all words with POS
<code>n</code> preceded by POS <code>clitic</code>”) are
possible.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The search query can be implemented either through user interaction
or via editing the script itself or some other method - whichever way
you choose, this should be clearly documented. The script should also
return data in some way, either by printing to the terminal or writing
to a file.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Once your Python script is working for the first text you
selected, test it on the second text to make sure that it works, and
make any necessary changes so that it works for both texts. Finally,
modify your program so that you can search across both texts
simultaneously. <strong>Bonus:</strong> get it to work on multiple
additional texts in the same format.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a short paper (no longer than 5 pages) describing your
goals, data, process, and results. This paper should include some
background information on the language you chose, with relevant
linguistic information and citations for your sources. Submit this paper
as a PDF along with your annotated/commented Python code and the texts
you chose in a Github repository. The PDF should also be submitted via
TurnItIn. Make sure to provide examples of your queries and results in
the paper or as separate files, and describe any challenges you
faced.</p></li>
